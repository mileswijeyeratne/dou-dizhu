# Dou DiZhu (WIP)

## Overview

This is an implementation of the card game Dou DiZhu (Landlord) made with python (backend) and typescript/react (frontend). 

Currently the game is playable with each player in their own browser (however only locally). Planning on implementing more features such as auth and stats tracking with a postgres database aswell as fleshing out the frontend (it looks kinda janky)

## Run

Simply clone the repo and, with docker engine running, run `docker compose up -d` in the root of the project. The frontend will then be accessable at `localhost:8080`
